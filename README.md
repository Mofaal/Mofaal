## Projects


### Intrusion Detection with Snort
- **Type:** School Project
- **Date:** May 2024
- **Description:** Implemented and explored Snort, an open-source network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS), to enhance understanding of defensive measures against network-based attacks.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Utilized Snort's rule-based IDS capabilities to discern potentially dangerous packets by comparing them to signatures of malicious traffic.
  - Configured Snort to detect simple traffic patterns, such as port scans, using both pre-defined and custom rules.
  - Documented project findings and observations using various analysis tools such as Snort command console, alert logs, and Wireshark.

### Metasploit Attack and Exploitation
- **Type:** School Project
- **Date:** March 2024
- **Description:** Deployed and configured virtual machines within a lab environment to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios. Conducted Metasploit attack "Eternal Blue" to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Executed commands within the Metasploit framework to set up and launch the exploit, including configuring payload, setting target IP addresses, and initiating the attack.
  - Documented and analyzed attack results, including capturing screenshots of the victim system, extracting system information, and assessing the impact of the attack on system integrity.
</div>

### Network Security Lab - Penetration Testing and Analysis
- **Type:** School Project
- **Date:** January 2024
- **Description:** Configured and initiated virtual machines to replicate network security scenarios. Employed tools like Wireshark and Nmap for real-time monitoring, analysis, and vulnerability assessment.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Conducted host discovery procedures using Nmap and employed Wireshark for real-time monitoring and analysis of network traffic.
  - Utilized Zenmap for OS fingerprinting and executed service discovery scans to ascertain the presence of services and protocols on target systems.
</div>

### Trojan Deployment and Rootkit Implementation
- **Type:** School Project
- **Date:** December 2023
- **Description:** Implemented Beast Trojan on a Windows 7 virtual machine and conducted penetration testing on a Windows Server 2003 VM. Utilized Hacker Defender rootkit to conceal the presence of the Beast Trojan.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Configured server settings and initiated the trojan to establish communication with a target system.
  - Utilized Hacker Defender rootkit to conceal the presence of the Beast Trojan, implementing hidden processes, ports, and files to evade detection.
</div>

### JavaFX MySQL Application Development
- **Type:** School Project
- **Date:** October 2023
- **Description:** Implemented a three-tier architecture application utilizing JavaFX for the user interface tier and JDBC for database connectivity.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Configured MySQL database, created tables, and populated data using provided scripts.
  - Developed the DBAccess class to handle user input and execute SQL queries for data retrieval.
</div>

### Active Directory Implementation and Security Project
- **Type:** School Project
- **Date:** March 2023
- **Description:** Designed and implemented Active Directory OU structure for the Student Union department, demonstrating share and file-system security.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Created Active Directory OU structure for the Student Union department and implemented necessary groups and Group Policies.
  - Developed file system mirroring the OU design, demonstrating share and file-system security to control access for each unit's employees.
